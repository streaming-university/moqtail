### Minor Changes

- [#33](https://github.com/streaming-university/moqtail/pull/33) [`0b59e15`](https://github.com/streaming-university/moqtail/commit/0b59e1582aca3eb307e75097b4a3716971dd523d) Thanks [@LeventAksakal](https://github.com/LeventAksakal)! - Refactor fetch message structure for better type safety and API design
  - **BREAKING**: Refactored `Fetch` class to use discriminated union for `typeAndProps`
    - Removed static factory methods (`Fetch.newStandAlone`, `Fetch.newRelative`, `Fetch.newAbsolute`)
    - Combined fetch type and properties into a single discriminated union field
    - Enables automatic TypeScript type narrowing based on fetch type
  - **NEW**: Implemented both publisher and subscriber functionality for fetch operations
  - **TODO**: Joining fetches require additional handling (partial implementation)
  - **PERFORMANCE**: Reduced test timeouts to improve CI pipeline speed
    - Telemetry tests: 5s → 1s timeouts
    - ControlStream tests: 3s → 1s timeouts
    - AkamaiOffset tests: mocked network calls instead of real ones
  - **CI**: Update husky hooks
    - Remove exec < /dev/tty from pre-commit and prepare-commit-msg for windows compatibility
  - **FIX**: Track alias map
    - Track alias map was using number for track alias instead of bigint
    - Update the structure and relevant parts of the code

  This change provides a more idiomatic and type-safe API for fetch operations while maintaining backward compatibility for serialization/deserialization.

  - **BREAKING**: Updated subscribe request API for better control and lifecycle management
  - **NEW**: Added update functionality to subscribe requests
    - Allows modifying subscription parameters after initial request
    - Enables dynamic subscription management
  - **NEW**: Added cancel functionality to subscribe requests
    - Provides clean subscription cleanup
    - Prevents memory leaks from abandoned subscriptions
  - **PERFORMANCE**: Removed slow Akamai unit tests
    - Tests were causing CI pipeline delays
  - **API**: Improved client API ergonomics
    - Better type safety for subscribe operations
    - Remove redundant public identifiers (everything is public by default)
    - Use # for private members

  This change provides better control over subscription lifecycle
